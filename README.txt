serveup 

A tool to serve up local directories using a minimally-configured Apache.

Maybe useful for development.

Written as an experiment to see how small the Apache config file can be.

serveup -h for help.

Was tested on Arch Linux with Apache 2.4. Other versions may require 
configuration changes.
